# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), a fundamental machine 

learning algorithm used for classification and regression. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and

visualization techniques to enhance understanding.


# üìå Features of this Notebook

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing & Exploration**

Loads dataset (e.g., Iris Dataset or Heart.csv).

Performs data cleaning and transformation.

Uses seaborn & matplotlib for data visualization.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Scaling & Normalization**

Standardizes numerical features using StandardScaler from Scikit-Learn.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ KNN Model Implementation**

Implements KNeighborsClassifier from Scikit-Learn.

Splits data into training and test sets.

Trains the KNN model and makes predictions.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation**

Measures performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Uses cross-validation to find the best value of K.

Plots accuracy vs. K value to optimize hyperparameters.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
